## 2. Regulation and Security

### Is JustMarkets Regulated?

JustMarkets is regulated by the **Financial Services Authority (FSA), Seychelles** under license number SD088. Although the FSA is an offshore regulator and considered less stringent than Tier-1 authorities like FCA (UK) or ASIC (Australia), it does impose several regulatory requirements to protect traders.

### Security Measures

- **Segregated client funds**: JustMarkets keeps client deposits in separate bank accounts, isolated from company operational funds.  
- **SSL encryption**: Website and trading platforms use SSL certificates to secure data transmission.  
- **Negative balance protection**: Prevents clients from losing more than their deposited amount.  
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security for client accounts.

### Transparency and Compliance

JustMarkets regularly publishes legal documents, terms & conditions, and risk disclosures on its website, allowing traders to make informed decisions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note*: Traders in Europe or the US may want to consider brokers regulated by local authorities due to stricter compliance requirements.
